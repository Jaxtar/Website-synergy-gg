	Synergy - For Gamers, By Gamers. 
	Whether it's learning a new language, create a splendid masterpiece or performing a game-winning wombo: none of it matters if you don't have anyone to share the moment with. We have a vision.  We believe that every person deserves a place to fit in; what does it mean to belong? To us it means family, even if you're half the world away- every member has purpose and potential.  What makes us different from any other group is that we're a community, bringing to life a story collectively with the efforts of hard working members for all to savor. Maybe you're in search for new experiences; you may not have been in a community or tournament before, Synergy aspires to create an environment that brings gaming to life in a way that you have never experienced before. We're here to play & grow together. Synergy rests on peaceful enviroment, loyalty, and integrity. There is a heavy emphasis on maturity, fair play, helping others and having a fun and competitive gaming experience that all can enjoy.
